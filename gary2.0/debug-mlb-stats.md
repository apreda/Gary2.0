# MLB Stats API Debug Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Variable Redeclaration Error
**Problem**: The `scheduleResponse` variable was declared twice in the same scope.
**Fix**: Renamed the first occurrence to `initialScheduleResponse` and the second to `fallbackScheduleResponse`.

### 2. Silent Error Handling
**Problem**: The original code used `.catch(() => ({}))` which silently swallowed errors, making it impossible to debug why stats were returning null.
**Fix**: Replaced with proper try-catch blocks with detailed logging.

### 3. Enhanced Stats Retrieval Function
**Problem**: The original `getPitcherSeasonStats` function might have been failing silently.
**Fix**: Created `getPitcherSeasonStatsEnhanced` with:
- Better error logging
- Raw response logging for debugging
- Fallback to previous year's stats if current year fails
- Proper timeout handling
- User-Agent headers for better API compatibility

### 4. Improved Logging
**Problem**: Insufficient logging made it hard to debug issues.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging at each step:
- Raw API responses
- Processed stats
- Error details
- Fallback attempts

## Key Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
// Before: Silent failure
const stats = await originalService.getPitcherSeasonStats(pitcher.id).catch(() => ({}));

// After: Detailed error handling with fallbacks
const stats = await getPitcherSeasonStatsEnhanced(pitcher.id);
```

### Better API Requests
```javascript
// Added proper headers and timeout
const response = await axios.get(`${MLB_API_BASE_URL}/people/${playerId}/stats`, {
  params: {
    stats: 'season',
    group: 'pitching',
    season: new Date().getFullYear(),
    sportId: 1
  },
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; GaryAI/1.0)'
  },
  timeout: 10000
});
```

### Fallback Mechanism
If current year stats fail, the system now tries:
1. Previous year's stats
2. Different API endpoints
3. Graceful degradation with empty stats object

## Testing the Fix

To test if the enhanced service is working:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for detailed logging messages like:
   - `[MLB API] Getting season stats for pitcher {id}`
   - `[MLB API] Raw response for pitcher {id}:`
   - `[MLB API] Processed stats for pitcher {id}:`

2. **Verify Stats Structure**: The returned stats should include:
   ```javascript
   {
     era: number,
     wins: number,
     losses: number,
     inningsPitched: string,
     strikeouts: number,
     whip: number,
     battingAvgAgainst: string,
     walks: number,
     hits: number,
     homeRuns: number,
     gamesStarted: number,
     year: number,
     gamesPitched: number
   }
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**: If stats are still null, check the console for:
   - API endpoint errors
   - Network timeouts
   - Invalid player IDs
   - MLB API rate limiting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Player ID Not Found
**Symptoms**: `Cannot get stats for pitcher: No pitcher ID provided`
**Solution**: Check if the probable pitcher data includes valid player IDs

### Issue: API Rate Limiting
**Symptoms**: HTTP 429 errors or timeouts
**Solution**: Add delays between requests or implement retry logic

### Issue: Off-Season Data
**Symptoms**: No current year stats available
**Solution**: The enhanced function now automatically falls back to previous year

### Issue: Invalid API Response
**Symptoms**: Empty stats object despite successful API call
**Solution**: Check the raw response logging to see the actual API structure

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Logs**: Run the enhanced service and monitor console output
2. **Verify Data**: Check that pitcher stats are properly populated
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Test with games that have TBD pitchers
4. **Performance**: Monitor API response times and add caching if needed

## Usage Example

```javascript
import { mlbStatsApiService } from './src/services/mlbStatsApiService.enhanced.js';

// Get games with enhanced pitcher stats
const games = await mlbStatsApiService.getGamesWithStartingPitchers('2024-12-19');

// Check if stats are properly loaded
games.forEach(game => {
  const homePitcher = game.enhancedData?.homeProbablePitcher;
  const awayPitcher = game.enhancedData?.awayProbablePitcher;
  
  if (homePitcher?.seasonStats?.era) {
    console.log(`Home pitcher ${homePitcher.fullName} ERA: ${homePitcher.seasonStats.era}`);
  }
  
  if (awayPitcher?.seasonStats?.era) {
    console.log(`Away pitcher ${awayPitcher.fullName} ERA: ${awayPitcher.seasonStats.era}`);
  }
});
```

The enhanced service should now provide detailed logging and proper error handling to help identify any remaining issues with MLB stats retrieval.
