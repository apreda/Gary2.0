# NHL Playoff Implementation Summary - May 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive NHL playoff stats using Ball Don't Lie API, replacing the broken `statsapi.web.nhl.com` endpoints. The new implementation focuses exclusively on 2025 playoff data (2024-25 NHL season) for accurate current picks.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. NHL Team Management
- `getNhlTeams()` - Fetch all NHL teams from Ball Don't Lie API
- `getNhlTeamByName(nameOrId)` - Smart team lookup with multiple matching strategies
- Supports team name, abbreviation, and ID lookups
- Enhanced matching for variations like "Edmonton Oilers" vs "Oilers"

### 2. NHL Playoff Games (2025 Playoffs Only)
- `getNhlPlayoffGames(season, todayOnly)` - Get playoff games for 2024 season (2024-25 NHL season)
- `getTodaysNhlPlayoffGames()` - Filter for today's playoff games only
- Proper season calculation: May 2025 = 2024 season (2024-25 NHL season)
- `postseason: true` parameter ensures only playoff data

### 3. Active Playoff Teams
- `getActiveNhlPlayoffTeams()` - Get teams currently in 2025 playoffs
- Extracts unique team IDs from all playoff games
- Used for filtering relevant playoff data

### 4. Playoff Series Analysis
- `getNhlPlayoffSeries(season, teamA, teamB)` - Analyze head-to-head playoff series
- Tracks wins/losses between specific teams
- Determines series status (ongoing, completed, etc.)
- Sorts games chronologically

### 5. Comprehensive Player Stats (Playoff-Only)
- `getNhlPlayoffPlayerStats(homeTeam, awayTeam)` - Get detailed playoff player performance
- **Critical**: Only playoff games, no regular season dilution
- Tracks last 5 playoff games per team
- Comprehensive stats including:
  - Basic: Goals, assists, points, +/-, penalty minutes
  - Shooting: Shots, shooting percentage, time on ice
  - Special teams: Power play goals/assists/points, short-handed stats
  - Goalie stats: Save percentage, GAA, wins/losses
  - Advanced: Faceoff percentage, hits, blocks

### 6. Game-Specific Stats
- `getNhlPlayoffGameStats(gameId)` - Get player stats for specific playoff games
- Used to build comprehensive player performance profiles
- Filters by team ID to separate home/away player stats

### 7. Comprehensive Analysis
- `getComprehensiveNhlPlayoffAnalysis(homeTeam, awayTeam)` - All-in-one analysis
- Combines player stats, series data, today's games, and active teams
- Returns structured data for pick generation

## Integration with Picks Service

### Updated NHL Processing
Replaced broken `nhlPlayoffService.generateNhlPlayoffReport()` with:
```javascript
const playoffAnalysis = await ballDontLieService.getComprehensiveNhlPlayoffAnalysis(
  game.home_team,
  game.away_team
);
```

### Enhanced Playoff Report Generation
- Generates detailed playoff reports from Ball Don't Lie data
- Includes top 3 performers from each team with key stats
- Shows series status if teams have played each other
- Provides 2025 playoff context (season, active teams, data source)

### Sample Report Format
```
# NHL PLAYOFF REPORT: Dallas Stars @ Edmonton Oilers

## Series Status: Edmonton Oilers 2 - 1 Dallas Stars

## Edmonton Oilers Top Playoff Performers:
- Connor McDavid: 1.2G, 2.1A, 3.3P per game (5 games)
  +/- +1.4, 15.2% shooting, 22.1 min TOI
- Leon Draisaitl: 0.8G, 1.6A, 2.4P per game (5 games)
  +/- +0.8, 12.5% shooting, 20.3 min TOI

## Dallas Stars Top Playoff Performers:
- Jason Robertson: 0.6G, 1.2A, 1.8P per game (5 games)
  +/- -0.2, 11.8% shooting, 18.7 min TOI

## 2025 Playoff Context:
- Season: 2024 (2024-25 NHL season)
- Active playoff teams: 16
- Data source: Ball Don't Lie API (playoff games only)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Season Calculation Logic
```javascript
const currentMonth = new Date().getMonth() + 1;
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
const actualSeason = currentMonth <= 6 ? currentYear - 1 : currentYear;
// May 2025 → actualSeason = 2024 (for 2024-25 NHL season)
```

### API Parameters
```javascript
const apiParams = {
  seasons: [actualSeason],
  postseason: true, // CRITICAL: Only playoff games
  per_page: 100
};

// For today's games only:
if (todayOnly) {
  apiParams.dates = [today]; // YYYY-MM-DD format
}
```

### Player Stats Aggregation
- Accumulates stats across multiple playoff games
- Calculates per-game averages for meaningful comparisons
- Filters players with at least 1 playoff game
- Sorts by points per game for top performers

### Enhanced Team Matching
- Direct name/abbreviation matching
- Partial name matching for variations
- City/team name extraction (e.g., "Edmonton" from "Edmonton Oilers")
- Fallback strategies for alternative team names

## Benefits Over Previous Implementation

### 1. Current Data Only
- **Before**: Mixed regular season and outdated playoff data
- **After**: Exclusively 2025 playoff performance data

### 2. Reliable API
- **Before**: Broken `statsapi.web.nhl.com` (ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED)

- **After**: Full player profiles including advanced metrics

### 4. Better Team Matching
