# NBA 2025 Playoffs - Complete Integration Summary

## üèÜ Overview
Gary 2.0 has been fully optimized for the 2025 NBA playoffs using the Ball Don't Lie API. This integration provides comprehensive, real-time playoff analysis with accurate season handling, advanced statistics, and injury tracking.

## üîß Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Season Parameter Bug Fix (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: API was returning ALL playoff games from ALL seasons instead of just 2025 playoffs
**Solution**: Added proper `seasons: [2024]` parameter for 2025 playoffs
```javascript
// Fixed API call for 2025 playoffs
const response = await client.nba.getGames({ 
  postseason: true,
  seasons: [2024], // 2025 playoffs = 2024 season
  per_page: 100
});
```

### 2. Consistent Season Logic
**Implementation**: All functions now use consistent season calculation
```javascript
const currentMonth = new Date().getMonth() + 1;
const actualSeason = currentMonth <= 6 ? season - 1 : season;
// January-June 2025 ‚Üí 2024 season (2025 playoffs)
// July-December 2025 ‚Üí 2025 season (2026 playoffs)
```
