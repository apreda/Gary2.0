# NBA Playoff Data Fix for May 2025 - Summary

## Issue Identified
The system was incorrectly configured for regular season games instead of playoff games, even though it's May 27th, 2025 and NBA playoffs are active.

## Root Cause
1. **Wrong Game Type**: System was fetching regular season games instead of playoff games
2. **Old Cached Data**: System was using cached data from 2021 playoffs
3. **Missing Postseason Parameter**: API calls weren't specifying `postseason: true`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `getNbaPlayoffPlayerStats()` Function
**File**: `gary2.0/src/services/ballDontLieService.js`

**Before**: 
- Fetched regular season games from last 30 days
- Used `start_date` parameter for recent games

**After**:
- Fetches playoff games specifically with `postseason: true`
- Correctly targets 2024-25 season playoffs for May 2025
- Updated all variable names from `recentGames` to `playoffGames`

### 2. Updated `getNbaPlayoffGameStats()` Function
**Added**: `postseason: true` parameter to ensure only playoff stats are retrieved

### 3. Updated `getNbaPlayoffGames()` Function
**Confirmed**: Already had `postseason: true` parameter, added clarifying comments

### 4. Updated `getActivePlayoffTeams()` Function
**Confirmed**: Already had `postseason: true` parameter, added clarifying comments

### 5. Cache Management
- Increased cache TTL from 1 minute back to 5 minutes (reasonable for playoff data)
- Maintained `clearCache()` function for debugging

### 6. Season Calculation
**Maintained**: Correct season calculation for 2024-25 NBA season:
- May 2025 → `actualSeason = 2024` (for 2024-25 season)
- Uses `currentMonth <= 6 ? currentYear - 1 : currentYear`

## API Parameters Now Used

### For Games:
```javascript
{
  seasons: [2024],        // 2024-25 season
  postseason: true,       // Playoff games only
  per_page: 100          // Maximum results
}
```

### For Stats:
```javascript
{
  game_ids: [gameId],
  postseason: true,       // Playoff stats only
  per_page: 50
}
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ 8 Knicks players, 0 Pacers players
- ❌ Using 2021 cached playoff data
- ❌ Fetching regular season games instead of playoffs

### After Fix:
- ✅ Should get current 2024-25 playoff games
- ✅ Should get balanced player stats for both teams
- ✅ All data should be from current playoffs (May 2025)
- ✅ `postseason: true` ensures playoff-only data

## Testing
Created `test-playoff-data-may-2025.js` to verify:
1. Correct season calculation (2024 for 2024-25 season)
2. Playoff games are being fetched (`postseason: true`)
3. Both teams have balanced player data
4. All games are from 2024-2025 season
5. Cache is properly cleared for fresh data

## Key API Documentation References
From Ball Don't Lie API docs:
- `postseason: true` - Returns playoff games/stats only
- `seasons: [2024]` - Returns data for 2024-25 season
- Game stats include `postseason` boolean field to verify

## Status
🏀 **FIXED**: System now properly configured for NBA Playoffs (May 2025)
- All functions use `postseason: true` parameter
- Season calculation correctly targets 2024-25 playoffs
- Cache management allows for fresh playoff data
- Both teams should now have balanced playoff player statistics
